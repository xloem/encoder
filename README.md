This is attempt #2 to make a script that procedurally generates an encoder
wheel based on a color function of radius and angle.

The first attempts sputtered in the face of logic errors debugging, and
the low priority of the task for me.

NOTE: the original approach was going to use tricks to get extra accuracy out of the system. This is not currently present. I barely remember them, unfortunately.
